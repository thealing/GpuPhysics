# Solution Structure

## Simulator

Contains the cross-platform physics code and the executors for running the simulation on the CPU (single- or multi-threaded) and on the GPU.

## WpfApp2

Contains a WPF GUI application with example demos and debug tools.

I want to emphasize, that because of the limited time frame, **I made no effort to uphold any code quality** in this one (even the project name reflects this).
